      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am currently a student at Epicodus programming school, in the Intro to Programming class. Programming is very new to me, but I have very much enjoyed what I have learned and accomplished so far. I have chosen programming for a career change after a life of hard labor. I look forward to my future as a programmer and giving my body a much needed rest.</p>
      <h3>Here is some work that illustrates my first week of programming:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Very basic stuff.</li>
          <li>You can see I have learned a trick or two.</li>
          <li>I am beginning to understand styling.</li>
          <li>My pages look much more polished after only four days.</li>
        </ul>
